PyCon APAC のもの
=================
- https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/about/code-of-conduct/

PyCon APAC is a community-driven convention for the Python programming language in the Asia-Pacific region, created to facilitate discussions and exchange of ideas in the community. To provide a joyful, pleasant, and vibrant environment that creates value for all participants, we hereby publish PyCon APAC's Code of Conduct, which applies to all speech and action in both physical and digital venues of PyCon APAC. Your cooperation is necessary to help all of us to interact with respect and trust in PyCon APAC.

Code of Conduct
---------------
Attendees should not harass others, either by verbal or physical behavior. We have zero tolerance towards harassment or discrimination. Each attendee should be equally respected, regardless of his or her nationality, race, language, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, faith, profession, seniority, political view, or intellect.

Appreciate each other. Each attendee will be expected to have a professional attitude and behavior. Users of Python from different professional roles, technical backgrounds, and application areas use and contribute to the technology in many different ways, and some of them are amazingly unimaginable. Opinions or actions that undervalue other members of the community are inappropriate.

Show consideration to others. Sexual contents in any form are inappropriate in any conference venue, including, but not limited to talks, open spaces, or social media. Words and actions originated from stereotypes are discouraged. In the conference rooms, cell phones should be set to silence or a mode that doesn't annoy others.

The conference organizers have the power to take appropriate actions to redirect the behavior of those who violate the code of conduct. The violators may be forced to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the organizers.

This Code of Conduct is approved by the organizers of PyCon APAC.

PyCon US のもの
===============
- https://us.pycon.org/2014/about/what-is-pycon/

PyCon JP is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by PyCon or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any PyCon event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

The Short Version
-----------------

PyCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
