==================
What is PyCon
==================

PyCon is a conference organized and run by volunteers in the Python community that is dedicated to advancing and promoting the Python programming language. Through holding the PyCon JP conference, Python users can gather and exchange information with other deveopers from a wide variety of fields. It is our aim to create new relationships between the different communities and businesses using Python.

The theme for PyCon JP 2014 is "Re-discover Python". Through attending the conference, we hope that the attendees can learn new ways of using Python, and new areas within the Python community.

This year, we are looking for new ways, such as office hours and poster sessions, for attendees to meet and communicate with each other.
