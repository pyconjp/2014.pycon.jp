As a volunteer staff member you will be talking with the team leader and

Even if you aren't given tasks to do, we certainly value your input and
suggestions. We would like to make PyCon JP 2014 the best PyCon JP ever so
please let us know your ideas!

The number of team meetings varies from team to team but we are currently
trying to organize online as much as possible.

Staff Volunteer Time
----------------------------------

You can volunteer as many or as few hours as you like. We welcome those who
would like to spend as much time as is possible helping out, as well as those
who may have many other obligations and cannot volunteer as much time.

We also have a "staff work day" every month where staff can get together and
work through issues quickly.

Remote Communication
------------------------

You can volunteer from anywhere you have an internet connection.

We use `Slack <https://slack.com/>`_ as a chat communication tool and `JIRA
<https://www.atlassian.com/ja/software/jira>`_ for task management. You can do
almost any kind of volunteer work without regard for location.

Joining in
--------------------------------

The "staff work day" held every month is open to anyone, even those who are not
currently staff members. It is a great way to get accustomed to how we work,
and how much and where you might be able to volunteer your time.

We have an event page on `connpass <http://connpass.com/series/137/>`_ so you
can see when our next staff work day is and register to attend.

So you want to Volunteer!
